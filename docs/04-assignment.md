> Your first assignment requires that you have read and understand
> [Middleware](./04-lesson.md).

## Overview

In this assignment, you will implement an HTTP middleware that handles
the authentication mechanism you built in [Assignment 3](./03-assignment.md).
You will also implement other middleware, such as a logger middleware, and
*chain* them together so that every request interacts with all of the
middleware added to the chain.
