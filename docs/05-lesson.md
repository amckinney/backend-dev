We've covered a wide variety of concepts that pertain to server-side
programming, but now we shift our attention to integrating APIs from
other external servers. In this lesson, we will learn how we can add
dependencies on other services (that we do not operate ourselves) in
order to simplify or improve our application's functionality. We will
also learn about *microservices* and discuss how the *RPC* abstraction
empowers developers in a variety of ways.

## What is an RPC?

A [remote procedure call][1] (*RPC*)
