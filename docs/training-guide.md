If this is your first time mentoring for this course, or if you're just visiting
to brush up on your understanding, you've come to the right place! The following
sections will guide you through a variety of course guidelines and helpful
teaching to ensure that students have a positive learning experience.

## Responsibilities

As a mentor in this course, you will be responsible for the following:

* Independently guide several students through their experience in developing a backend application.
* Review code and provide constructive feedback.
* Expect to give between 2 and 4 hours a week towards mentoring, depending on the student's needs.
  * Some weeks may be busier than others, depending on the complexity of the week's assignment.
* Participate in weekly check-ins with each student.

## Guidelines

### Create a safe learning environment

The most important thing you can do as a mentor is to make people feel they are in a **safe
learning environment**. As mentors, we should do everything we can to make programming
interesting and exciting, but necessarily challenging, too. Many students will be frustrated
and confused throughout their experience; it's important that these students learn to embrace
this challenge.

### Reviewing code

The mentor's primary purpose is to _guide_ students to improve their understanding
of the course material. The majority of this learning process is expected to occur
during code review.

#### Strategies

Effective code review takes practice, and is often learned through _experience_. In this
class, mentors are expected to spend adequate time with the code to fully understand the
student's solution and overall approach. **It's often helpful to check out the student's
branch locally so that you can leverage your IDE or text editor of choice.**

#### Code style

It's important that students conform to Go language style guides, such as [Effective Go][1].
You are not expected to know all of the principles described in such texts off the top of
your head, but **you should make code cleanliness and style a priority in your critiques.**

If you spot a [code smell][2], call it out and have a discussion about it! Your student is
_not_ expected to refactor and address all of their code with respect to your feedback;
it's important that you give them an opportunity to provide their own opinions and discuss!
Who knows, you might even learn something!

#### Don't give solutions away

During code review, mentors **MUST NOT** give the student a working solution if the
student has not already solved the problem on their own. However, it is encouraged to
offer alternative solutions once the student has demonstrated that they've successfully
solved the problem and therefore independently grasped the concept.

### Communication

Mentors will be able to formally communicate with the course staff, other mentors, and their
students in Piazza, Slack, weekly check-ins and through code review. Each communication platform
is suitable in different situations, some of which are described below.

#### Piazza

Piazza is used for mentors and students to post questions or tips that *should be shared
amongst all other students*. For example, if you find yourself referencing an insightful
article or website in a code review, make a post about it! The course staff and future mentors
will be able to learn from previous knowledge sharing, so these efforts will improve the
course over time.

With that said, encourage your students to use Piazza in the same way! They will be graded
on participation, so this is a great way for them to earn those points.

#### Slack

Slack is useful for ad hoc support that doesn't necessarily warrant an individual Piazza post.
Students will likely use this for programming support amongst one another, but they are not
allowed to give each other answers on this platform. **If you notice any such exchanges in
one of the public channels, please notify the staff with a link to the thread immediately.**

You should also use Slack to communicate with other mentors for ad hoc assistance. But remember,
please create a private Piazza post for other mentors if there's any chance that other mentors
can also benefit!

#### Weekly check-ins

The weekly check-in is an opportunity for students to receive 1:1 support and should feel
like private office hours. This experience will largely depend on each student's preference
and relative skill level, so be prepared for a wide range of experience.

We ask that you keep a lightweight thread of notes and talking points between you and your
students. This simple exercise can give students a much more gratifying experience following
the conclusion of the course; the record shows how far they've come and how much they've grown
since starting their journey.

Again, the most important thing you can do as a mentor is to make people feel they are in a
**safe learning environment** throughout their experience.
