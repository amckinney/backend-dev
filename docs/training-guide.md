If this is your first time mentoring for this course, or if you're just visiting
to brush up on your understanding, you've come to the right place! The following
sections will guide you through a variety of course guidelines and helpful
teaching to ensure that students have a positive learning experience.

## Responsibilities

As a mentor in this course, you will be responsible for the following:

* Independently guide several students through their experience in developing a backend application.
* Review code and provide constructive feedback.
* Expect to give between 2 and 4 hours a week towards mentoring, depending on the student's needs.
  * Some weeks may be busier than others, depending on the complexity of the week's assignment.
* Participate in weekly check-ins with each student.

## Guidelines

### Reviewing code

The mentor's primary purpose is to _guide_ students to improve their understanding
of the course material. The majority of this learning process is expected to occur
during code review.

#### Strategies

Effective code review takes practice, and is often learned through _experience_. In this
class, mentors are expected to spend adequate time with the code to fully understand the
student's solution and overall approach. **It's often helpful to check out the student's
branch locally so that you can leverage your IDE or text editor of choice.**

#### Style

It's important that students conform to Go language style guides, such as [Effective Go][1].
You are not expected to know all of the principles described in such texts off the top of
your head, but **you should make code cleanliness and style a priority in your critiques.**

If you spot a [code smell][2], call it out and have a discussion about it! Your student is
_not_ expected to refactor and address all of their code with respect to your feedback;
it's important that you give them an opportunity to provide their own opinions and discuss!
Who knows, you might even learn something!

#### Don't give solutions away

During code review, mentors **MUST NOT** give the student a working solution if the
student has not already solved the problem on their own. However, it is encouraged to
offer alternative solutions once the student has demonstrated that they've successfully
solved the problem and therefore independently grasped the concept.

### Communication

Mentors will be able to formally communicate with the course staff, other mentors, and their
students in Piazza, Slack, weekly check-ins and through code review.
