> Your seventh assignment requires that you have read and understand
> [Continuous integration](./07-lesson.md).

## Overview

tests that should be verified before we release anything to production.
In this assignment, you will add some continuous integration workflows
to the Github repository that contains your version of the `Issue Tracker`
application.
