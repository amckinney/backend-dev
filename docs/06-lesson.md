This lesson builds upon the previous [Calling APIs](./05-lesson.md) lesson
and describes how we can write [unit tests][1] for code that normally
requires an internet connection and a real application server to respond
to each request. *Mocking* these API calls is a helpful tool that adds test
coverage to your application to increase confidence in your implementation.
