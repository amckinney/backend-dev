Welcome! This is the landing page for the Backend Development course.

This page provides an overview of the course, which is still a
work-in-progress.

## Overview

As computer science students, we're actively learning new foreign concepts,
data structures, and algorithms. However, in most undergraduate computer
science curriciulums, we rarely get to incorporate these principles
into designing a realistic software application.

**This class is primarily meant for the students interested in learning more
about software engineering.** Not all of you will have an opportunity to work
in the software engineering industry via an internship, so this class is built
to fill in the knowledge gaps that you would otherwise learn in the industry.

## Readiness

A few things are expected of students entering this class:

  * You have a working understanding of data structures and algorithms,
    equivalent to two semesters of undergraduate coursework.
  * You are comfortable with remote work and can operate independently.
  * You are willing to participate in peer review and collaborate
    with a mentor.

## Learning outcomes

* Students will learn to operate autonomously in a realistic software engineering
  environment.
