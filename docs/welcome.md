## Overview

As computer science students, we're actively learning new foreign concepts,
data structures, and algorithms. However, in most undergraduate computer
science curriciulums, we rarely get to incorporate these principles
into designing a realistic software application.

**This class is primarily meant for the students interested in learning how to
work as a software engineer.** Not all of you will have an opportunity to
work in the software engineering industry via an internship, so this class is
built to fill in the knowledge gaps that you would otherwise learn in the industry.

## Readiness

A few things are expected of students entering this class:

  * You have a working understanding of data structures and algorithms,
    equivalent to two semesters of undergraduate coursework.
  * You are comfortable with remote work and can operate independently.
  * You are willing to participate in peer review and collaborate
    with a mentor.

## Learning outcomes

* Learn to operate autonomously in a realistic software engineering environment.
* Use the Go programming language.
* Develop an HTTP server that defines a REST/JSON API.
* Store data in a relational, SQL database.
* Work with build systems and other automation techniques, such as CI workflows.
* Write unit and integration tests.
* Review code and provide constructive criticism.

## Curriculum

This course is broken up into a collection of units that focus on a specific area
within backend software development. Students will start by increasing their
understanding of the command line, then move into server-side development, and
finally look at software release processes and advanced programming techniques, such
as metaprogramming.

Each of these domains are taught through the lens of a realistic issue tracker
application, similar to [Jira][1] or [Asana][2].
