## Grading

The course is graded on a toal of 1000 points exactly, such that 10 points
represent a single percentage point. With that said, the course uses the
traditional A-F grading scale, where each grade band is represented below.

|  A   |  B   |  C   |  D   |  F   |
|------|------|------|------|------|
| >=90 | >=80 | >=70 | >=60 | <=59 |

### Participation (15%)

Although not the most significant portion of your grade, we intentionally list
the participation assessment because of its importance. Software engineering is
an inherently collaborative practice, often requiring dozens (if not [hundreds][1])
of engineers working on the same source code repository.

In this class, you will be responsible for reviewing other students' code, participating
in forum discussions on Piazza, and communicating with your peers in Slack. You are
not forced to use each of these platforms extensively; you should be able to do so with
any platform on its own, a subset of the platforms, or all of the platforms in combination.

Each of your contributions will be individually graded and assigned a point allocation. For
example, an exemplary code review could receive up to 10 points if it exceeds all of our
expectations, whereas another code review could only earn 1 point if it is clearly lacking
in substance and quality.

### Assignments (65%)

The assignments are the primary source of your grade in this class. Each unit will have one
or more assignments with one or more individual tasks for you to complete. The deliverables
for each assignment will also vary between units. For example, some units will require that
you submit your solution with a lightweight technical document that justifies the decisions
you've made, whereas others will require that you provide a certain number of test cases.

In general, your assignments will be graded on completeness and correctness. Code style will
also be taken into account, but it will only account for 5% of the total assignment grade.

### Final project (20%)

The final project will feel very familiar to the assignments you've completed in the class
up to this point, but will be larger in scope and open-ended. 80% of the final project grade
will be allocated towards completeness and correctness, 15% will be allocated to the final
project write-up, and the final 5% will, again, be devoted to code style.
